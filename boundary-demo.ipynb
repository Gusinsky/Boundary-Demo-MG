    "This terraform code builds an HCP Boundary enviroment that inclues connectivity to HCP Vault for credential brokering and injection, Okta integration for OIDC authentication and managed groups, and a number of AWS resources that are used as workers and Boundary targets.  \n",

    "This repo was build to run on Terraform Cloud/Enterprise.  It uses the tfe_outputs data source to pass parameters from the init module to the build module.  If you want to run this locally you will need to modify the code to use cross state sharing to populate those values.  Additionally, you will need to update or remote the cloud provider block to match your Terraform configuration. \n",
